Fairly simple but useful audio management app without requiring context-switching (alt tabs).

Why?
  Have you ever been focusing, maybe competitive gaming like DotA 2, SC2, and all of a sudden you need absolute focus? When the intensitity of gameplay ramps up, I often wished I could easily toggle mute on all non-vital apps.
  This app is meant to solve this.

  I often listen to YouTube when waiting in games with long respawns etc.

UI is rough and will be until the features are polished.
